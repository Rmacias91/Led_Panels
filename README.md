# Led_Panels
Raspberry Pi With LED Panels
This Project will display API's displaying sports, time, train times, twitter, etc, written in python.
An application for android will also be used to control the Raspberry Pi displaying features.
Hzeller's source code was used to display the text on to the ada fruit led panels. There are 2 panels daisy chained together. 
DOn't forget to run python ./Led_Panels updatePi.py from the directory so it deletes the older folder of Led_Panels.
